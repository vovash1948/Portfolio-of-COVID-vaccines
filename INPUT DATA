Input files
All files are text format. Originally, all files are in MS Excel, but then converted to text files (currently manually). All data for the model is in (MedXriv - appendix) 
INV1.SAV   - # vaccines, number of months in planning horizon,  # cycles, number phases, platforms, # leading vaccines, vaccine demand, # in-licencing deals, % increase or decrease manufacturing capacity
INV1A2.SAV – min probability for each platform
INV1A3.SAV - max probability for each platform
INV1A4.SAV - interdependence coefficients for each platform (success > 1)
INV1A5.SAV - interdependence coefficients for each platform, failure <1
INVB1.SAV - production capacity for each platform
INV2.SAV – probabilities of success for each phase and platform. 
INV4.SAV - lead vaccine (Operation Warp Speed (OWS)) vs. non-lead
INV5A.SAV – trials allocation across platforms
INV6.SAV – start phase for each candidate
INV7.SAV – number of trials per phase and platform
INV10.SAV – platform # for each vaccine
INV13.SAV- leading vaccine candidates (OWS) – numbers
INV14A.SAV – duration of a clinical trial
INV14B.SAV – accelerated duration of a clinical trial
INV16.SAV – number to start next platform (vaccine group)
INV17.SAV – number to calculate end of the group (for interdependence)
